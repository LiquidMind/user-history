00:00:00.246 --> 00:00:02.949
before we are able to hold up to

00:00:03.082 --> 00:00:04.684
15 minutes and still be able to

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:08.354
lift off today on falcon nine,

00:00:08.488 --> 00:00:10.122
listening and learning it all

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:12.225
with you at the very same time

00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:13.493
as they were on hold. I think

00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:14.560
they said that final

00:00:14.694 --> 00:00:15.595
pressurization was a little low

00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:18.130
is what I think I heard him say.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.132
Um and then the second stage

00:00:20.132 --> 00:00:20.700
they're working on doing some

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.169
purging for more on what that is

00:00:23.302 --> 00:00:24.136
going to mean. I'm gonna bring

00:00:24.136 --> 00:00:26.639
miles o'brien back in miles.

00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:28.140
They just said that they can

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.675
hold for 15 minutes and still be

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:31.477
within the window and lift off

00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:32.745
will jump in as they give us

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.647
updates. But what do you hear in

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.116
this? Well in this business, you

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.684
have to be able to operate under

00:00:38.818 --> 00:00:40.920
pressure. Shall we say a and

00:00:41.053 --> 00:00:44.156
that's quite literal. It's um

00:00:44.156 --> 00:00:46.259
you know, if you recall it's

00:00:46.392 --> 00:00:49.762
scrubbed a few days ago for lack

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:51.264
of backfill kind of pressure.

00:00:51.397 --> 00:00:52.164
Imagine like when you're

00:00:52.164 --> 00:00:53.733
drinking water out of plastic

00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.701
water bottle and you kind of

00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:56.802
critique wrinkles if you don't

00:00:56.936 --> 00:00:58.838
get airbag in it. Well you don't

00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:00.172
want to rocket to crinkle. And

00:01:00.172 --> 00:01:02.241
so what they do is they take the

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:04.510
gaseous methane and oxygen and

00:01:04.644 --> 00:01:05.778
kind of pump it back in the

00:01:06.178 --> 00:01:08.180
tanks, so it doesn't crinkle. So

00:01:08.247 --> 00:01:09.782
in this case, they had to fully

00:01:10.182 --> 00:01:11.717
pressure on eyes all these fuel

00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:14.186
lines for 33 rockets, and it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.488
took a little longer than they

00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:17.456
expected. And so they went into

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.759
a hold. For now they've got in

00:01:20.192 --> 00:01:21.360
total of 62 minute window. So

00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:24.730
we've got some more time here.

00:01:24.864 --> 00:01:26.999
Ah to play around as you can see

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.200
as that. You see that what

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.869
appears to be steamed, venting

00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:31.771
off the rocket that is liquid

00:01:32.204 --> 00:01:33.105
methane. But oxygen is kind of

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:34.473
bleeding off, so they gotta keep

00:01:34.607 --> 00:01:36.208
it topped off at a certain

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:38.210
point. They have to stop.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.078
Hopefully they can get the

00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:40.246
pressure where it needs to be.

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:41.681
Well, thank you. Miles looks

00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:43.082
like the countdown just just

00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:44.450
started again. Just started back

00:01:44.584 --> 00:01:47.853
up miles so now at 26 seconds

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.921
people are cheering. You can

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:50.222
hear them there. Let's listen in

00:01:50.256 --> 00:02:01.901
you guys.

00:02:02.234 --> 00:02:17.249
Eight. Yes. MM hmm.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.270
Stop. Chamber pressure is

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:46.278
nominal. 33 seconds into the

00:02:46.278 --> 00:02:49.682
point. The inaugural vehicles.

00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:52.618
You're gonna picks over reports

00:02:52.752 --> 00:02:55.655
first stage engines nominal.

00:02:55.788 --> 00:02:57.723
What a sight from the ground

00:02:57.857 --> 00:02:59.959
cameras extraordinary flying it

00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:10.302
twice the thrust of the five.

00:03:10.436 --> 00:03:16.976
We're down in front of back up.

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.310
The period of maximum

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:27.153
aerodynamic question. Velocity

00:03:27.286 --> 00:03:28.320
increases. The depth of the

00:03:28.454 --> 00:03:31.223
atmosphere is decreasing. That's

00:03:31.357 --> 00:03:32.425
cute stress on the vehicle call

00:03:32.558 --> 00:03:42.868
out next few now. Continuing to

00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:44.804
watch the first stages. We head

00:03:44.937 --> 00:03:51.744
down range. 100 seconds into

00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:58.517
flight. The next major activity

00:03:58.651 --> 00:04:01.921
is going to be the first stage.

00:04:02.354 --> 00:04:03.122
Houston tracking station now

00:04:03.255 --> 00:04:06.459
acquiring the vehicle. Shut down

00:04:06.592 --> 00:04:09.495
super heavy. Mission of the

00:04:09.628 --> 00:04:13.532
starship engines. What starts up

00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:15.835
separates light up six engines

00:04:15.968 --> 00:04:18.037
in the staggered sequence all

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.371
goes well. Those six engines

00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:21.474
will burn from 6.5 minutes

00:04:21.607 --> 00:04:28.047
onboard view from starship. Of

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.416
the rafter engines on the second

00:04:30.549 --> 00:04:31.617
page. Prepare for stage

00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:34.587
separation. After stage

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.388
separation, the first stage will

00:04:36.489 --> 00:04:37.590
flip and begin to boost back

00:04:37.723 --> 00:04:38.657
maneuver for landing in the

00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:51.337
gulf.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.439
Continuing to fly two minutes 40

00:04:53.572 --> 00:04:55.174
seconds. Let's get ready for

00:04:55.307 --> 00:05:00.412
main engine cut off. Stretch and

00:05:00.412 --> 00:05:02.748
cut off beginning to flip for

00:05:02.882 --> 00:05:17.897
stage separation

00:05:35.114 --> 00:05:35.214
.

00:05:35.347 --> 00:05:36.782
As of right now, we are awaiting

00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:41.020
stage separation. First starship

00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:42.454
should separate from the super

00:05:42.454 --> 00:05:48.460
heavy booster. Yeah, Kate right

00:05:48.594 --> 00:05:50.462
now, it looks like we saw the

00:05:50.496 --> 00:05:51.697
start of the flip, but obviously

00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:53.199
we're seeing from the ground

00:05:53.332 --> 00:05:54.867
cameras. The entire starship

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.769
stack continue to rotate. We

00:05:56.902 --> 00:05:57.736
should have had separation by

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.973
now. Obviously this is does not

00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:02.107
appear to be a nominal

00:06:02.474 --> 00:06:04.476
situation. Yeah, it does appear

00:06:04.476 --> 00:06:06.478
to be spinning, but I do want to

00:06:06.612 --> 00:06:08.981
remind everyone that everything

00:06:09.114 --> 00:06:10.482
after clearing the tower was

00:06:10.482 --> 00:06:25.497
icing on the cake.

00:06:42.848 --> 00:06:44.750
Obviously something just went a

00:06:44.884 --> 00:06:46.518
little bit wrong. Despite the

00:06:46.518 --> 00:06:48.087
cheering you're seeing right now

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.622
, let's bring in miles o'brien.

00:06:49.755 --> 00:06:51.724
We did see the launch of the

00:06:51.857 --> 00:06:53.993
starship rocket all was going

00:06:54.126 --> 00:06:56.528
well, that it ended with an

00:06:56.528 --> 00:06:57.429
explosion there. Miles. Explain

00:06:57.563 --> 00:07:02.601
what happened. Uh well, you, um

00:07:02.735 --> 00:07:04.103
there will be a lot of

00:07:04.536 --> 00:07:05.604
discussion about this. This the

00:07:05.738 --> 00:07:07.806
one thing I did notice, John. As

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.009
it went up, there was a shot

00:07:10.142 --> 00:07:11.477
where you could see the bottom

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.178
of the rocket. As I told you

00:07:13.312 --> 00:07:15.281
earlier, there are 33 separate

00:07:15.414 --> 00:07:17.650
rapture engines on this vehicle

00:07:17.783 --> 00:07:23.355
. Six of them had not lit. To what

00:07:23.489 --> 00:07:25.157
we just saw. I don't know. I

00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:26.558
mean, without six engines that

00:07:26.592 --> 00:07:27.927
would potentially affect the

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.595
ability of the rocket to remain

00:07:29.728 --> 00:07:32.564
stable. And that could, uh,

00:07:32.564 --> 00:07:33.999
ultimately have led to what

00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:36.568
we've seen here now is that an

00:07:36.568 --> 00:07:37.770
actual explosion of the rocket

00:07:37.903 --> 00:07:40.039
or was a button pushed on the

00:07:40.172 --> 00:07:41.774
ground? The self destruct button

00:07:41.907 --> 00:07:43.742
, which is designed to keep the

00:07:43.876 --> 00:07:45.244
rocket from flying into harm's

00:07:45.377 --> 00:07:47.413
way, we'll find out more about

00:07:47.546 --> 00:07:50.149
that as well. Ah having said all

00:07:50.582 --> 00:07:51.617
of that, given all of the

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.719
explosions that have led to this

00:07:53.852 --> 00:07:55.254
moment since 2005. This is

00:07:55.387 --> 00:07:57.122
serial number 24 for the

00:07:57.256 --> 00:07:59.158
starship and there's been

00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:00.793
several mishaps along the way,

00:08:00.926 --> 00:08:02.728
all of which they've learned

00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:04.596
from you see the team at

00:08:04.596 --> 00:08:06.165
Hawthorne, the young team,

00:08:06.598 --> 00:08:08.767
they're cheering. Ah you know,

00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:09.735
they would probably try to

00:08:09.868 --> 00:08:11.270
characterize this as a pretty

00:08:11.403 --> 00:08:13.272
good success. They got past they

00:08:13.405 --> 00:08:14.606
light lit up most of the

00:08:14.606 --> 00:08:15.541
engines. They got past the

00:08:15.674 --> 00:08:17.943
launchpad didn't damage it and

00:08:18.077 --> 00:08:19.478
all of the data that they've

00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:21.180
gathered up to the point where

00:08:21.313 --> 00:08:23.248
things went awry will likely

00:08:23.382 --> 00:08:25.517
inform the next test flight,

00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:27.052
which is gives us another

00:08:27.186 --> 00:08:29.388
opportunity to meet once again.

00:08:29.521 --> 00:08:30.756
It was, of course we look

00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:32.624
forward to, I think, even right

00:08:32.624 --> 00:08:33.592
before Monday's attempt, Elon

00:08:33.726 --> 00:08:35.527
Musk said. As long as they don't

00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:37.629
blow up the launch pad that is a

00:08:37.763 --> 00:08:38.897
success in this in this critical

00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:42.267
test miles. Stick with us. I

00:08:42.634 --> 00:08:43.369
want to get over to Ed

00:08:43.502 --> 00:08:44.636
lavandera, who's on the ground.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.638
Of the things that was

00:08:46.638 --> 00:08:48.941
unmistakable was the was the

00:08:49.074 --> 00:08:51.010
sound from people around you

00:08:51.143 --> 00:08:52.644
over the sound from somewhere

00:08:52.644 --> 00:08:54.079
the roar of the crowd that we

00:08:54.213 --> 00:08:55.848
heard upon lawn. Just tell us

00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:59.818
what happened. Look I got to

00:08:59.952 --> 00:09:01.754
tell you. You're looking at a

00:09:01.887 --> 00:09:02.788
kid from the eighties who never

00:09:02.921 --> 00:09:04.656
got to see a space shuttle

00:09:04.656 --> 00:09:05.591
launch inversion. So this is the

00:09:05.724 --> 00:09:07.760
first time I've ever experienced

00:09:07.893 --> 00:09:08.794
anything like this. Um and it

00:09:08.927 --> 00:09:11.363
was surreal. Uh we saw the

00:09:11.497 --> 00:09:13.399
rocket take off and it was well

00:09:13.532 --> 00:09:16.268
past the top of the launch pad,

00:09:16.668 --> 00:09:18.670
and then all of the sudden we

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.838
started feeling you could feel

00:09:19.972 --> 00:09:20.773
the rumbling. You could feel it

00:09:20.906 --> 00:09:22.741
in your in your in your chest

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:24.743
and you were kind of shaking.

00:09:24.877 --> 00:09:25.644
That's how powerful it was. And

00:09:25.778 --> 00:09:27.880
it was. It was really, really

00:09:28.013 --> 00:09:29.381
breathtaking. So that was in the

00:09:29.515 --> 00:09:31.750
crazy thing is like I think I

00:09:31.884 --> 00:09:33.752
knew that was going to happen,

00:09:33.886 --> 00:09:34.686
and it was still stunning to

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.088
experience and it was almost

00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:37.556
moving, like in slow motion from

00:09:37.689 --> 00:09:39.124
our vantage point. I know it's

00:09:39.258 --> 00:09:40.692
not moving in slow motion, but

00:09:40.692 --> 00:09:42.194
from our vantage point, it

00:09:42.327 --> 00:09:44.029
seemed very slow. And at one

00:09:44.163 --> 00:09:45.197
point I was wondering like, is

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.698
it really going to get up there?

00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:48.867
And so now, that's kind of the

00:09:49.001 --> 00:09:49.535
experience and the cheering

00:09:49.668 --> 00:09:50.969
here. We talked to one gentleman

00:09:51.103 --> 00:09:53.272
a couple of days ago who had

00:09:53.405 --> 00:09:54.740
driven in from Georgia to be

00:09:54.873 --> 00:09:55.574
here for this week. You can

00:09:55.707 --> 00:09:57.076
almost tell you like tears in

00:09:57.209 --> 00:09:58.710
his eyes is as this was

00:09:58.811 --> 00:10:00.045
happening, and then we saw it

00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:02.714
kind of go off to the east,

00:10:02.714 --> 00:10:03.749
leaving this large cloud trail.

00:10:03.882 --> 00:10:05.384
And even from there, you could

00:10:05.517 --> 00:10:06.351
still hear and feel the rumbling

00:10:06.718 --> 00:10:08.854
sound. And then it was that what

00:10:08.987 --> 00:10:10.956
the spacex officials describe as

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.791
the unplanned this assembly,

00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:15.094
which is just a technical way of

00:10:15.227 --> 00:10:16.962
saying that it all went terribly

00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:19.765
wrong. You can hear the rumbling

00:10:19.898 --> 00:10:20.999
from that from our vantage point

00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:22.734
. And just so you know, we are

00:10:22.734 --> 00:10:24.736
five miles from the launch pad,

00:10:24.736 --> 00:10:26.271
and we are many more miles from

00:10:26.405 --> 00:10:27.773
where this rocket ship

00:10:27.906 --> 00:10:30.008
disassembled over the gulf of

00:10:30.142 --> 00:10:31.176
Mexico. But clearly everybody

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.346
here on the ground. Leaves here

00:10:34.746 --> 00:10:36.081
feeling like they just witnessed

00:10:36.215 --> 00:10:38.750
one of the most historic events

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:39.818
, space travel events in their

00:10:39.952 --> 00:10:40.819
lifetime. Many people we've

00:10:40.953 --> 00:10:42.888
talked to here, guys, you know,

00:10:43.021 --> 00:10:44.389
they equate this to you know

00:10:44.756 --> 00:10:47.893
where they were when astronauts

00:10:48.026 --> 00:10:49.661
landed on the moon orbited the

00:10:49.795 --> 00:10:51.897
moon for the for the first time

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.099
they view all of this kind of in
