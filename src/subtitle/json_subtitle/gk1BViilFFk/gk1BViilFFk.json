I think\n\n00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:14.560\nthey said that final\n\n00:00:14.694 --> 00:00:15.595\npressurization was a little low\n\n00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:18.130\nis what I think I heard him say.\n\n00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.132\nUm and then the second stage\n\n00:00:20.132 --> 00:00:20.700\nthey're working on doing some\n\n00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.169\npurging for more on what that is\n\n00:00:23.302 --> 00:00:24.136\ngoing to mean. I'm gonna bring\n\n00:00:24.136 --> 00:00:26.639\nmiles o'brien back in miles.\n\n00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:28.140\nThey just said that they can\n\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.675\nhold for 15 minutes and still be\n\n00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:31.477\nwithin the window and lift off\n\n00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:32.745\nwill jump in as they give us\n\n00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.647\nupdates. But what do you hear in\n\n00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.116\nthis? Well in this business, you\n\n00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.684\nhave to be able to operate under\n\n00:00:38.818 --> 00:00:40.920\npressure. Shall we say a and\n\n00:00:41.053 --> 00:00:44.156\nthat's quite literal. It's um\n\n00:00:44.156 --> 00:00:46.259\nyou know, if you recall it's\n\n00:00:46.392 --> 00:00:49.762\nscrubbed a few days ago for lack\n\n00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:51.264\nof backfill kind of pressure.\n\n00:00:51.397 --> 00:00:52.164\nImagine like when you're\n\n00:00:52.164 --> 00:00:53.733\ndrinking water out of plastic\n\n00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.701\nwater bottle and you kind of\n\n00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:56.802\ncritique wrinkles if you don't\n\n00:00:56.936 --> 00:00:58.838\nget airbag in it. Well you don't\n\n00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:00.172\nwant to rocket to crinkle. And\n\n00:01:00.172 --> 00:01:02.241\nso what they do is they take the\n\n00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:04.510\ngaseous methane and oxygen and\n\n00:01:04.644 --> 00:01:05.778\nkind of pump it back in the\n\n00:01:06.178 --> 00:01:08.180\ntanks, so it doesn't crinkle. So\n\n00:01:08.247 --> 00:01:09.782\nin this case, they had to fully\n\n00:01:10.182 --> 00:01:11.717\npressure on eyes all these fuel\n\n00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:14.186\nlines for 33 rockets, and it\n\n00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.488\ntook a little longer than they\n\n00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:17.456\nexpected. And so they went into\n\n00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.759\na hold. For now they've got in\n\n00:01:20.192 --> 00:01:21.360\ntotal of 62 minute window. So\n\n00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:24.730\nwe've got some more time here.\n\n00:01:24.864 --> 00:01:26.999\nAh to play around as you can see\n\n00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.200\nas that. You see that what\n\n00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.869\nappears to be steamed, venting\n\n00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:31.771\noff the rocket that is liquid\n\n00:01:32.204 --> 00:01:33.105\nmethane. But oxygen is kind of\n\n00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:34.473\nbleeding off, so they gotta keep\n\n00:01:34.607 --> 00:01:36.208\nit topped off at a certain\n\n00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:38.210\npoint. They have to stop.\n\n00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.078\nHopefully they can get the\n\n00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:40.246\npressure where it needs to be.\n\n00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:41.681\nWell, thank you. Miles looks\n\n00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:43.082\nlike the countdown just just\n\n00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:44.450\nstarted again. Just started back\n\n00:01:44.584 --> 00:01:47.853\nup miles so now at 26 seconds\n\n00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.921\npeople are cheering. You can\n\n00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:50.222\nhear them there. Let's listen in\n\n00:01:50.256 --> 00:02:01.901\nyou guys.\n\n00:02:02.234 --> 00:02:17.249\nEight. Yes. MM hmm.\n\n00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.270\nStop. Chamber pressure is\n\n00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:46.278\nnominal. 33 seconds into the\n\n00:02:46.278 --> 00:02:49.682\npoint. The inaugural vehicles.\n\n00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:52.618\nYou're gonna picks over reports\n\n00:02:52.752 --> 00:02:55.655\nfirst stage engines nominal.\n\n00:02:55.788 --> 00:02:57.723\nWhat a sight from the ground\n\n00:02:57.857 --> 00:02:59.959\ncameras extraordinary flying it\n\n00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:10.302\ntwice the thrust of the five.\n\n00:03:10.436 --> 00:03:16.976\nWe're down in front of back up.\n\n00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.310\nThe period of maximum\n\n00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:27.153\naerodynamic question. Velocity\n\n00:03:27.286 --> 00:03:28.320\nincreases. The depth of the\n\n00:03:28.454 --> 00:03:31.223\natmosphere is decreasing. That's\n\n00:03:31.357 --> 00:03:32.425\ncute stress on the vehicle call\n\n00:03:32.558 --> 00:03:42.868\nout next few now. Continuing to\n\n00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:44.804\nwatch the first stages. We head\n\n00:03:44.937 --> 00:03:51.744\ndown range. 100 seconds into\n\n00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:58.517\nflight. The next major activity\n\n00:03:58.651 --> 00:04:01.921\nis going to be the first stage.\n\n00:04:02.354 --> 00:04:03.122\nHouston tracking station now\n\n00:04:03.255 --> 00:04:06.459\nacquiring the vehicle. Shut down\n\n00:04:06.592 --> 00:04:09.495\nsuper heavy. Mission of the\n\n00:04:09.628 --> 00:04:13.532\nstarship engines. What starts up\n\n00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:15.835\nseparates light up six engines\n\n00:04:15.968 --> 00:04:18.037\nin the staggered sequence all\n\n00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.371\ngoes well. Those six engines\n\n00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:21.474\nwill burn from 6.5 minutes\n\n00:04:21.607 --> 00:04:28.047\nonboard view from starship. Of\n\n00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.416\nthe rafter engines on the second\n\n00:04:30.549 --> 00:04:31.617\npage. Prepare for stage\n\n00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:34.587\nseparation. After stage\n\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.388\nseparation, the first stage will\n\n00:04:36.489 --> 00:04:37.590\nflip and begin to boost back\n\n00:04:37.723 --> 00:04:38.657\nmaneuver for landing in the\n\n00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:51.337\ngulf.\n\n00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.439\nContinuing to fly two minutes 40\n\n00:04:53.572 --> 00:04:55.174\nseconds. Let's get ready for\n\n00:04:55.307 --> 00:05:00.412\nmain engine cut off. Stretch and\n\n00:05:00.412 --> 00:05:02.748\ncut off beginning to flip for\n\n00:05:02.882 --> 00:05:17.897\nstage separation\n\n00:05:35.114 --> 00:05:35.214\n.\n\n00:05:35.347 --> 00:05:36.782\nAs of right now, we are awaiting\n\n00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:41.020\nstage separation. First starship\n\n00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:42.454\nshould separate from the super\n\n00:05:42.454 --> 00:05:48.460\nheavy booster. Yeah, Kate right\n\n00:05:48.594 --> 00:05:50.462\nnow, it looks like we saw the\n\n00:05:50.496 --> 00:05:51.697\nstart of the flip, but obviously\n\n00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:53.199\nwe're seeing from the ground\n\n00:05:53.332 --> 00:05:54.867\ncameras. The entire starship\n\n00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.769\nstack continue to rotate. We\n\n00:05:56.902 --> 00:05:57.736\nshould have had separation by\n\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.973\nnow. Obviously this is does not\n\n00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:02.107\nappear to be a nominal\n\n00:06:02.474 --> 00:06:04.476\nsituation. Yeah, it does appear\n\n00:06:04.476 --> 00:06:06.478\nto be spinning, but I do want to\n\n00:06:06.612 --> 00:06:08.981\nremind everyone that everything\n\n00:06:09.114 --> 00:06:10.482\nafter clearing the tower was\n\n00:06:10.482 --> 00:06:25.497\nicing on the cake.\n\n00:06:42.848 --> 00:06:44.750\nObviously something just went a\n\n00:06:44.884 --> 00:06:46.518\nlittle bit wrong. Despite the\n\n00:06:46.518 --> 00:06:48.087\ncheering you're seeing right now\n\n00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.622\n, let's bring in miles o'brien.\n\n00:06:49.755 --> 00:06:51.724\nWe did see the launch of the\n\n00:06:51.857 --> 00:06:53.993\nstarship rocket all was going\n\n00:06:54.126 --> 00:06:56.528\nwell, that it ended with an\n\n00:06:56.528 --> 00:06:57.429\nexplosion there. Miles. Explain\n\n00:06:57.563 --> 00:07:02.601\nwhat happened. Uh well, you, um\n\n00:07:02.735 --> 00:07:04.103\nthere will be a lot of\n\n00:07:04.536 --> 00:07:05.604\ndiscussion about this. This the\n\n00:07:05.738 --> 00:07:07.806\none thing I did notice, John. As\n\n00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.009\nit went up, there was a shot\n\n00:07:10.142 --> 00:07:11.477\nwhere you could see the bottom\n\n00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.178\nof the rocket. As I told you\n\n00:07:13.312 --> 00:07:15.281\nearlier, there are 33 separate\n\n00:07:15.414 --> 00:07:17.650\nrapture engines on this vehicle\n\n00:07:17.783 --> 00:07:23.355\n. Six of them had not lit. To what\n\n00:07:23.489 --> 00:07:25.157\nwe just saw. I don't know. I\n\n00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:26.558\nmean, without six engines that\n\n00:07:26.592 --> 00:07:27.927\nwould potentially affect the\n\n00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.595\nability of the rocket to remain\n\n00:07:29.728 --> 00:07:32.564\nstable. And that could, uh,\n\n00:07:32.564 --> 00:07:33.999\nultimately have led to what\n\n00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:36.568\nwe've seen here now is that an\n\n00:07:36.568 --> 00:07:37.770\nactual explosion of the rocket\n\n00:07:37.903 --> 00:07:40.039\nor was a button pushed on the\n\n00:07:40.172 --> 00:07:41.774\nground? The self destruct button\n\n00:07:41.907 --> 00:07:43.742\n, which is designed to keep the\n\n00:07:43.876 --> 00:07:45.244\nrocket from flying into harm's\n\n00:07:45.377 --> 00:07:47.413\nway, we'll find out more about\n\n00:07:47.546 --> 00:07:50.149\nthat as well. Ah having said all\n\n00:07:50.582 --> 00:07:51.617\nof that, given all of the\n\n00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.719\nexplosions that have led to this\n\n00:07:53.852 --> 00:07:55.254\nmoment since 2005. This is\n\n00:07:55.387 --> 00:07:57.122\nserial number 24 for the\n\n00:07:57.256 --> 00:07:59.158\nstarship and there's been\n\n00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:00.793\nseveral mishaps along the way,\n\n00:08:00.926 --> 00:08:02.728\nall of which they've learned\n\n00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:04.596\nfrom you see the team at\n\n00:08:04.596 --> 00:08:06.165\nHawthorne, the young team,\n\n00:08:06.598 --> 00:08:08.767\nthey're cheering. Ah you know,\n\n00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:09.735\nthey would probably try to\n\n00:08:09.868 --> 00:08:11.270\ncharacterize this as a pretty\n\n00:08:11.403 --> 00:08:13.272\ngood success. They got past they\n\n00:08:13.405 --> 00:08:14.606\nlight lit up most of the\n\n00:08:14.606 --> 00:08:15.541\nengines. They got past the\n\n00:08:15.674 --> 00:08:17.943\nlaunchpad didn't damage it and\n\n00:08:18.077 --> 00:08:19.478\nall of the data that they've\n\n00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:21.180\ngathered up to the point where\n\n00:08:21.313 --> 00:08:23.248\nthings went awry will likely\n\n00:08:23.382 --> 00:08:25.517\ninform the next test flight,\n\n00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:27.052\nwhich is gives us another\n\n00:08:27.186 --> 00:08:29.388\nopportunity to meet once again.\n\n00:08:29.521 --> 00:08:30.756\nIt was, of course we look\n\n00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:32.624\nforward to, I think, even right\n\n00:08:32.624 --> 00:08:33.592\nbefore Monday's attempt, Elon\n\n00:08:33.726 --> 00:08:35.527\nMusk said. As long as they don't\n\n00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:37.629\nblow up the launch pad that is a\n\n00:08:37.763 --> 00:08:38.897\nsuccess in this in this critical\n\n00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:42.267\ntest miles. Stick with us. I\n\n00:08:42.634 --> 00:08:43.369\nwant to get over to Ed\n\n00:08:43.502 --> 00:08:44.636\nlavandera, who's on the ground.\n\n00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.638\nOf the things that was\n\n00:08:46.638 --> 00:08:48.941\nunmistakable was the was the\n\n00:08:49.074 --> 00:08:51.010\nsound from people around you\n\n00:08:51.143 --> 00:08:52.644\nover the sound from somewhere\n\n00:08:52.644 --> 00:08:54.079\nthe roar of the crowd that we\n\n00:08:54.213 --> 00:08:55.848\nheard upon lawn. Just tell us\n\n00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:59.818\nwhat happened. Look I got to\n\n00:08:59.952 --> 00:09:01.754\ntell you. You're looking at a\n\n00:09:01.887 --> 00:09:02.788\nkid from the eighties who never\n\n00:09:02.921 --> 00:09:04.656\ngot to see a space shuttle\n\n00:09:04.656 --> 00:09:05.591\nlaunch inversion. So this is the\n\n00:09:05.724 --> 00:09:07.760\nfirst time I've ever experienced\n\n00:09:07.893 --> 00:09:08.794\nanything like this. Um and it\n\n00:09:08.927 --> 00:09:11.363\nwas surreal. Uh we saw the\n\n00:09:11.497 --> 00:09:13.399\nrocket take off and it was well\n\n00:09:13.532 --> 00:09:16.268\npast the top of the launch pad,\n\n00:09:16.668 --> 00:09:18.670\nand then all of the sudden we\n\n00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.838\nstarted feeling you could feel\n\n00:09:19.972 --> 00:09:20.773\nthe rumbling. You could feel it\n\n00:09:20.906 --> 00:09:22.741\nin your in your in your chest\n\n00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:24.743\nand you were kind of shaking.\n\n00:09:24.877 --> 00:09:25.644\nThat's how powerful it was. And\n\n00:09:25.778 --> 00:09:27.880\nit was. It was really, really\n\n00:09:28.013 --> 00:09:29.381\nbreathtaking. So that was in the\n\n00:09:29.515 --> 00:09:31.750\ncrazy thing is like I think I\n\n00:09:31.884 --> 00:09:33.752\nknew that was going to happen,\n\n00:09:33.886 --> 00:09:34.686\nand it was still stunning to\n\n00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.088\nexperience and it was almost\n\n00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:37.556\nmoving, like in slow motion from\n\n00:09:37.689 --> 00:09:39.124\nour vantage point. I know it's\n\n00:09:39.258 --> 00:09:40.692\nnot moving in slow motion, but\n\n00:09:40.692 --> 00:09:42.194\nfrom our vantage point, it\n\n00:09:42.327 --> 00:09:44.029\nseemed very slow. And at one\n\n00:09:44.163 --> 00:09:45.197\npoint I was wondering like, is\n\n00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.698\nit really going to get up there?\n\n00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:48.867\nAnd so now, that's kind of the\n\n00:09:49.001 --> 00:09:49.535\nexperience and the cheering\n\n00:09:49.668 --> 00:09:50.969\nhere. We talked to one gentleman\n\n00:09:51.103 --> 00:09:53.272\na couple of days ago who had\n\n00:09:53.405 --> 00:09:54.740\ndriven in from Georgia to be\n\n00:09:54.873 --> 00:09:55.574\nhere for this week. You can\n\n00:09:55.707 --> 00:09:57.076\nalmost tell you like tears in\n\n00:09:57.209 --> 00:09:58.710\nhis eyes is as this was\n\n00:09:58.811 --> 00:10:00.045\nhappening, and then we saw it\n\n00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:02.714\nkind of go off to the east,\n\n00:10:02.714 --> 00:10:03.749\nleaving this large cloud trail.\n\n00:10:03.882 --> 00:10:05.384\nAnd even from there, you could\n\n00:10:05.517 --> 00:10:06.351\nstill hear and feel the rumbling\n\n00:10:06.718 --> 00:10:08.854\nsound. And then it was that what\n\n00:10:08.987 --> 00:10:10.956\nthe spacex officials describe as\n\n00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.791\nthe unplanned this assembly,\n\n00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:15.094\nwhich is just a technical way of\n\n00:10:15.227 --> 00:10:16.962\nsaying that it all went terribly\n\n00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:19.765\nwrong. You can hear the rumbling\n\n00:10:19.898 --> 00:10:20.999\nfrom that from our vantage point\n\n00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:22.734\n. And just so you know, we are\n\n00:10:22.734 --> 00:10:24.736\nfive miles from the launch pad,\n\n00:10:24.736 --> 00:10:26.271\nand we are many more miles from\n\n00:10:26.405 --> 00:10:27.773\nwhere this rocket ship\n\n00:10:27.906 --> 00:10:30.008\ndisassembled over the gulf of\n\n00:10:30.142 --> 00:10:31.176\nMexico. But clearly everybody\n\n00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.346\nhere on the ground. Leaves here\n\n00:10:34.746 --> 00:10:36.081\nfeeling like they just witnessed\n\n00:10:36.215 --> 00:10:38.750\none of the most historic events\n\n00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:39.818\n, space travel events in their\n\n00:10:39.952 --> 00:10:40.819\nlifetime. Many people we've\n\n00:10:40.953 --> 00:10:42.888\ntalked to here, guys, you know,\n\n00:10:43.021 --> 00:10:44.389\nthey equate this to you know\n\n00:10:44.756 --> 00:10:47.893\nwhere they were when astronauts\n\n00:10:48.026 --> 00:10:49.661\nlanded on the moon orbited the\n\n00:10:49.795 --> 00:10:51.897\nmoon for the for the first time\n\n00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.099\nthey view all of this kind of in\n\n"]
